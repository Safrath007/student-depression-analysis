📊 Student Depression Data AnalysisEnd-to-End Insights: From SQL Server Architecture to Tableau Visualization🚀 Project OverviewThis project explores the factors influencing mental health among students. By analyzing variables such as academic pressure, financial stress, and sleep patterns, this analysis aims to identify high-risk groups and provide data-driven recommendations for educational institutions.🛠️ Tech StackDatabase: Microsoft SQL Server (Data Cleaning & Transformation)Visualization: Tableau (Interactive Dashboards)Data Source: [Link to your dataset, e.g., Kaggle]🏗️ The Data PipelineExtraction: Imported raw student data into SQL Server.Transformation (SQL): * Handled missing values and standardized categorical data.Created views for "High-Stress Indicators" to simplify the Tableau connection.Performed CTE-based analysis to compare GPA vs. Depression levels.Visualization (Tableau): * Connected Tableau to the cleaned SQL views.Designed a multi-page dashboard focusing on demographic and academic correlations.🖼️ Dashboard Preview(Insert a high-quality screenshot of your Tableau dashboard here)🔗 View Interactive Dashboard on Tableau Public📈 Key InsightsThe GPA Paradox: Students with a GPA between 3.5 and 3.8 reported 15% higher stress levels than those below 3.0.Sleep Deprivation: A direct 0.78 correlation was found between less than 5 hours of sleep and severe depression scores.Financial Impact: Financial pressure was the #1 predictor of academic dissatisfaction across all demographics.📂 Repository StructureFolderDescription/sqlContains .sql scripts for table creation and data cleaning./dataRaw and processed datasets (CSV)./tableauThe .twbx workbook and static dashboard images.📝 How to UseSQL: Run the scripts in the /sql folder to recreate the database schema.Tableau: Open the .twbx file in the /tableau folder (requires Tableau Desktop or Public).Analysis: Refer to the Key Insights section above for a summary of findings.
